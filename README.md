# now playing©️

## Description

now playing©️ is the ultimate app for finding out what movies are playing right now, and that's about it. You likely already know what's in the theaters, but when you need a quick app to show your squad before you make plans for the evening, this is it. Movie data is populated via [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). Account handling is done via a local backend built in Express.

This project was done as a part of Turing School of Software and Design's curriculum. You can find out more here(https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker).

## Inspiration

I was mostly inspired by the American Apparel (rip) app. I wanted something simple and bold that provided only the necessary information you could want when you're checking to see what's in theatres.

## Wireframe

It didn't take me long to get my ideas on paper, it took me 3x as long to execute them because of my unfamiliarity with SASS and SmaCCS. It was a learning experience for sure
